                    It is the year 2984 and Mankind have colonized most planets in the solar system. 
                    You and three others have been selected to be the pioneering crew on the Columbus 
                    expedition; the first manned expedition outside the gravity of our sun. 
                    You take off from the NASA Galaxy base, on Neptune, and the whole crew is put in cryosleep, 
                    for a comfortable trip. <br />
                    ** An unknown amount of time passes ** <br />
                    You are slowly woken from you cryosleep and find that your spaceship has crashed and two 
                    of the cryocapsules are completely smashed. The last capsule cannot open. You are on your 
                    own, on an unknown planet, somewhere far into deep space.
